# LFCS Exam Tips

Following or some helpful tips I've noticed while preparing for LFCS Exam.

## 1. Practice

Practice commands and arguments and know the tools. Do linux challenges labs or practice exams e.g. from KodeKloud.

## 2. Familiarity with man

Learn how to search for commands by using man -k keyword or man -K keyword. Get familiar with man pages and how to navigate them and understand their layout also use -i for case-insensitive searching. 

## 4 Mock Exam

This is very important if you are not working professionally with linux.
- Practice as much as possible (Time yourself)
- When you book exam you get killer.sh two sessions that's very similar to actual exam format. (It's generally harder than real exam)
