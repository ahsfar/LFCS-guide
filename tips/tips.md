# Tips

Following or some helpful tips I've noticed while preparing for LFCS Exam.

## 1. Practice (Do the Killer.sh mock exams)

- Practice commands and arguments and know the tools. Do linux challenges labs or practice exams e.g. from KodeKloud.
- I would recommend installing Linux distro VM in your personal machine if you don't have one already and play around with that just get comfortable and use all the commands while practicing.

## 2. Familiarity with man pages

Learn how to search for commands by using man -k keyword or man -K keyword. Get familiar with man pages and how to navigate them and understand their layout also use -i for case-insensitive searching.

## 4 Mock Exam

This is very important if you are not working professionally with linux.
- Practice as much as possible (Time yourself)
- When you book exam you get killer.sh two sessions that's very similar to actual exam format. (It's generally harder than real exam)
- 36 hours to try the mock exams as many time as you want and Questions and Answers will be available after the exam attempt is finished.

#  Experience - Pending

## 3. Discounts

There are normally discounts on courses, certs or bundles from Linux Foundation. So, always look out for that. 
Got 50% of on Cyber Monday Deals. That's probably the biggest discount.
